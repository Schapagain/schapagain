<h1> Hi ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

### I'm Sandesh - a certified <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31644566-sandesh-chapagain">book</a> addict.

Besides spending time with those rectangular pieces of magic, I also do web development, mountain biking, <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/88362612">tutoring</a>, and beginner levels of creative writing. Recently, I have also been trying to write helpful articles on programming and web development - aimed at beginners - on <a href="https://zagzig.medium.com/">Medium</a>.

Please feel free to look around, and hit me up if you have any project ideas.<br/>
